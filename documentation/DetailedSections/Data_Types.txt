Data_Types.txt

The old version of ClimateSERV used a concept called 'DataTypes'.
In order to support end user legacy calls, this DataTypes concept has been integrated with the new Dataset IDs.
This means that requests for data (calculations processing and/or data downloads) still require this DataType.

Each of these data types have been mapped to the existing Datasets in the system.

Efforts were made to keep these datatypes pointing at the same datasets that they previously used.

Here is the list of current datatypes as of the time of this doc writing.
