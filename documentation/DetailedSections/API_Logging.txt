Ignore List
    Look in the django Settings for a variable named "API_LOGGING_ENDPOINT_IGNORE_LIST"
    This variable is a list of strings.
    If you want the endpoint to be ignored in the logs, add the endpoint as a string to this list.
    Note: This is an exact match, so for best results, pick the endpoint you want to ignore from the logs, then copy and paste from the logs screen to the settings.
    For Examples:
        # Works - Blocks this endpoint
            '/api_v2/get_server_versions/'
        # These do not work
            'api_v2/get_server_versions'
            'get_server_versions'
