            (1) Update the System.  Make sure package manager is up to date
            sudo dnf update -y
                # No Issues

            (2) Installing and Setting up Python 3

                # Python 3.6.8
            pip3 -V
                # pip 9.0.3 from /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages (python 3.6)

            (3) Setting up a Virtual Environment
            mkdir /cserv2/python_environments/environments/
            cd /cserv2/python_environments/environments/

            # use chown on the directory so that you do not have to use sudo when setting up the environment

            # Setup the environment
            python3 -m venv py36_climateserv_2_env
            cd py36_climateserv_2_env

            # Activating the environment
